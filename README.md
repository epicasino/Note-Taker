# [Note-Taker (UCSD Challenge #11)](https://note-taker-challenge-11-ucsd-53f90d47f2b1.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

- A simple to use note-taking application that saves and deletes user-made notes in a sleek, pleasing interface.
- Built using JavaScript, with NodeJS as the Server Environment and Express.js as the Web Framework.
- Working with a web framework to fetch data from a set database has furthered my knowledge in building scalable, interactive, and responsive Web Applications.

## Installation

[**Live deployment from Heroku- Access by clicking here.**](https://note-taker-challenge-11-ucsd-53f90d47f2b1.herokuapp.com/)

**Self-Host/Local Deployment**

- For self-testing purposes, you may want to deploy the application locally.
- **NOTE**: Make sure you have NodeJS installed. [Link to NodeJS here.](https://nodejs.org/en)

1. Clone repository from GitHub (RECOMMENDED), or download the source ZIP folder.
2. Once the repository has been cloned (or extracted), open your preferred command-line application.
3. Once in your command-line, do `npm i` to download the necessary dependencies.
4. After successfully getting the dependencies, do `node server.js` to start the server locally.
5. The server will be hosted on `http://localhost:3001` and all routes will be listening in on that local port.
